                                                This project is on “Sentiment Analysis of Tweet Data” is a sentiment analysis project based on big data analytics. This project will help us to analyze sentiment from twitter generated text data. Which will be able to show the sentimental state for a person or a specific topic or whatever we want. The aim for our project is to build up an application which will be able to connect non-technical people to the field of data mining. Where using simple user interface they will be able to create a report based on their search keyword. This application is very simple and easy to use. So it will be comfortable for everyone to use it. To develop this project we just need to know R language and platform and its library. To create the user interface we used shiny, which is a package including PHP and HTML to create a web application. We will input inside the shiny app and in the background R will do the data collection, analysis and output generation. Then shiny will print the output in the web application. After completing the application the application is working fine and its main task is running the application on the browser, which is taking input and providing us output based on input.

Most of them are in text format.Therefore, the demand of topic modeling is higher than ever right now.Data scientists are working day and night to make it more effective andaccurate using different methods. Topic modeling focuses on thekeywords that can express or identify the topic discussed in thedocument. Topic modeling can save a lot of time by releasing its userfrom page to page manual reviewing. In this paper a model has beenproposed to find out topic of a document. This model works based onthe relations between most frequent words and their relation withsentences in the document. This model can be used to increase theaccuracy of the topic modeling.

                                                Physically disabled people are neglected in every step of their life. Even if they have the ability to do much more they cannot express themselves due to the disability. This project focuses on building a smart wheelchair that can be controlled by the hand movement of the user using IoT technology. This wheelchair can move forward, right and left based on the command given to the system by the user. As well as if in anytime user face any kind of problem or difficulty or critical situation and need someone emergency then simply tap on the sensor will activate an emergency SMS to given emergency contacts. This project will reduce the complexity of movement and make life easier for disabled people by opening new opportunities in his/her life.

                                                <p>This era of computing made everything computerized. So people started to interact in the virtual life more than real life. From shopping to talking everything is controlled by computer. Because of that it has become more and more important to analyze and extract sentiment. Sentiment can be extracted from different type of data format like audio, text, image and so on. In this paper we proposed some methods to analyze text data in the paragraph level. Those methods can be implemented using bag of words and priority was given to the lexical based analysis.

Topic modeling focuses on the keywords that can express or identify the topic discussed in the document. Topic modeling can save a lot of time by releasing its user from page to page manual reviewing. In this paper a model has been proposed to find out topic of a document. This model works based on the relations between most frequent words and their relation with sentences in the document. This model can be used to increase the accuracy of the topic modeling.</p>

                                                <p>
                                                    Current world is growing so fast and communication between nation and different type of people with different language became part of our life. Even from buying product to our social life everything is dependent on communication. Therefore language is the most important part of human life. Though still now there is a language barrier for communication betwee people. But very soon language will be universal and everyone will be able to communicate in any language worldwide using the NLP technology. For that it is necessary to understand each language individually. This research proposes a new type of text generation of Bangla language using the bi-directional RNN. This technique is used to predict the next possible word in a Bangla text.

                                                    In this era of technology people are much more interested to buy things on the internet instead of going to market and facing different types of trouble. Book is one of the mostly sold products on online by different online stores. Amazon is one of the best and leading online stores which have worldwide popularity. Amazon has million dollar transaction every year with its rich variety of product and book is one of the best-selling products of Amazon. Sentiment is therefore holding a very strong position in market analysis and future business development. Based on sentiment now it is possible to predict everything about business based on the user and other NLP related fields where opinion comes from someone. This research focuses on determining the quality of books as well as authors through the analysis of review comments and rating provided by the user. To determine that lexicon based analysis is used here and using bag of word positivity and negativity of the review was determined. So that people can find the best book they need within a short time and without facing difficulty.

                                                    We are living in the age of technology, where every possible of problem of real life are solved by technology. We know there are many blind peoples, those who are outside of the touch of the technology. They have problems on each steps they want to go forward. Blind peoples cannot always get properdirection to their destination path and also hard to find out what object that he/she interact with. So in this approach, this project is trying to implemensomething which can help not only their easy movement but also give them a virtual vision. In this implementation we will use NodeMCU and mobile camera which will be guided by OpenCv library using Python to detect an object which the user is holding on. It will also spell it out that what the object is, so that they can have a virtual vision also. On the other hand there will be other sonar sensors which will include vibration motor to sense the blind person that there is an obstacle ahead in that direction. The future work of this project will be, give the blind person proper direction to his/her way using google map.

                                                    In this current world where everyday people are generating a large amount of data and different business organizations are becoming more and more dependent on it, therefore it has become very important to come out of the traditional methods of data analysis and focusing on the techniques that can prepare much more accurate and valid result to make business decision more easy and simple. This thesis proposes a technique to collect and analyze Twitter posts based on different keyword based product searching to generate products market statistical report. Using this program it can be determined that if any product is getting popularity or losing its market. Few types of results were generated in this project. Each of them has their own type of importance. Overall this type of application can be trusted support for a business analyst or decision makers. 												</p>

The conversion is possible by analyzing facial expression using deep learning method. But this conversion is a challenging task due to the varieties of pronunciation and accents of the same word causing different countenance. In this research, a method of converting video data to text data through lip reading has been proposed. The proposed method includes test dataset, image frame analysis and having text output from identified words. In the proposed technique, the test dataset will be organized by combining all the possible facial expressions of different words.

                                                    Crime is one of the major challenges of the world which is affecting the normal life and socio-economic development. Therefore, many governments are trying to use advanced technology to address or tackle such issues to maintain the peace of the country. So the analysis on Crime data has a great impact and value for the current scenario of the world. Nowadays, online newspaper is very popular among the people and contents varieties of crime news which can be a great source to understand the types and occurrence of crime. The aim of this paper is to monitor the crime, based on the headlines of the online newspaper provided in Twitter. Our approach is based on sentiment analysis by applying lexicon based methods and understand the crime categorized in a day, month, location and week. This piece of research work will help to deep understanding the pattern of the crime as well as the possibilities of occurrence of the crime in the specific time or day which will bear a great value to ensure the securitypurpose. 												</p>
